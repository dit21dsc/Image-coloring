# Image-coloring

This project implements a deep convolutional neural network for automatic colorization. It is trying to handle the problem of converting grayscale input images into colored images. The techique for the conversion inspired by work from Iizuka et al., Zhang et al., and Larsson et al. on image colorization. On the way the approach changed so the final solution follows the tactic of training a CNN with grayscale images and relevant RGB and next use the trained model to predict the RGB display of unknown grayscaled images

All code is open-source and implementation details are described in the project report.
